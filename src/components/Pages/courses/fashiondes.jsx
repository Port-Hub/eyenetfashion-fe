                Costume jewelry is often 'mixed media', meaning that it's made 
                from a combination of different materials such as metal, clay, 
                fabric, plastic etc. Costume jewelry making is accessible to everyone 
                and is a popular and fun hobby. To make your own jewelry means that 
                you can keep up-to-date with fashion trends for much less money, 
                plus you can make accessories that are completely unique to you. If 
                you see a necklace, bracelet or pair of earrings you like in a high 
                street shop then you can use it for inspiration to make your own 
                homemade version.
